            <p>
            Greetings! My name is Kevin Chow and I am an incoming freshmen majoring in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine. I was born in Danbury, Connecticut and raised in Santa Clara, California. Living in the heart of the Silicon Valley, I was fortunate to gain exposure to digital technology at an early age. However, I only became really interested in computer hardware and programming after my experience in the eighth grade Lego FIRST competition. Our team needed to construct and to program a robot that could complete a course with multiple challenges. In the programming process, our team could have either programmed the robot with simple commands or intelligent commands to fulfill the course. The idea that we can program the computer with intelligence has ever since fascinated me. Although our team was only playing with Legos, the same concept from that experience is still very much applied in CS programming such as the use of Boolean statements. Ever since, I took computer oriented courses in my high school years and taught myself how to program with different languages. This interest has propelled me to apply for Computer Science in college and in the end I felt UC Irvine was where I belonged. One of my distinguishable characteristics is taking initiative to solve the task at hand. If I encounter a problem, I would admit it and try to solve the problem instead of complaining about it.
